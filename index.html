        <h2> Education </h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I am a penultimate year student at <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/" target="_blank"> Singapore University of Technology and Design</a>
            under a bond-free <a href="https://scholarshipguide.com.sg/scholarship/sutd-global-distinguished-scholarshipaward" target="_blank"> Global Distinguished Scholarship</a>
            and I major in Computer Science and Design
        </p>
        <h2> Work Experience </h2>
        <p> I was previously a Business Analyst intern in the Payments and Deposits team at <a href="https://trustbank.sg/" target="_blank"> Trust Bank Singapore</a> where I was formally employed by <a href="https://www.sc.com/sg/">Standard Chartered Bank</a>
        <br>
        <p> I was previously a Data Analyst intern in the Portfolio Strategy team at <a href="https://www.changiairport.com/en/cai.html" target="_blank">Changi Airport International</a>, the investment and consultancy arm of Changi Airport Group, where I worked on <a href="https://www.sgx.com/indices/products/iegatenr" target="_blank">iEdge-GateEq Aviation and Travel Index</a></p>
        
    

        <h2> Research Publication </h2>


        <p> 
            After my coursework with <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, I had the greatest privilege to continue on a research project where we received funding by <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)</a> under Professor <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/" target="_blank">Christopher Manning</a>
            (whom I also drew inspiration from in the creation of a personal website).
            We have just submitted our first abstract paper to <a href="https://neurips.cc/">NeurIPS 2025</a> so stay tuned for more updates! </p>
        <br> 
        <p>I am currently working on Gaussian diffusion models with one of my favourite profs I have met on campus.</p>
