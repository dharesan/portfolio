    <title>I stopped my friend from taking a bamboo shoot during mala and I regretted</title>

    <h1>Allow your friend the bamboo shoot</h1>
    <p>Today I had mala dinner with a few of my closest friends at school. It was day one of another semester and i had 
        the sweetest dinner to celebrate the end of the day with over a nice yummy mala. While 
        we were picking out the mala ingredients together, my friend took two heavy bamboo shoot, and I swear it felt like they were 
        2 kg dumbells each. Gosh I thought to myself, these bamboo shoot is going to cost us a bomb cuz you know 
        some mala stalls go by weight (grrrr) and not by portions.
    </p>

    <p>And so i verablised my thought process and said, "Eh take one only ah, very heavy eh.." 
        My friend was so kind and we place one bamboo shoot back on the mala shelf. I did that (kinda) knowing 
        the bamboo shoot was one of my friend's favourite ingredients in mala. 
    </p>

    <p>Over dinner, the same friend confided with us that his grandfather just passed on over the weekend. 
        My gosh. We then had a very heartwarming conversation about the cycle of lives and the impact of the loss of our loved ones. 
    </p>

    <p>Apart from going over quotes such as "To learn how to live, you must learn how to die", 
        "we become emotionally stronger from such experiences", I learnt to always let my friend take the second bamboo shoot. Let them do it. 
    <br>
    More generally, be kind to people around you, friends or strangers- always allow them to take the second bamboo shoot for you never know what they are going through. 
    </p>
